# SpaghettiMix
A script to spaghettify tweets.

Every 15 minutes, it pulls the most recent tweets of a given user. If it hasn't already replied to the newest one, it replaces a word in the tweet with "spaghetti" and replies with that.

Designed for use with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), and takes advantage of [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit).
